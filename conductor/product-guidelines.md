- **Pragmatic & Practical:** The content should be direct, actionable, and helpful for practitioners. The goal is to bridge the gap between research and real-world application.

## Visual Design
- **Clean & Minimal:** Prioritize readability and content clarity. Avoid unnecessary distractions and maintain a focus on the core information.
- **Accessible & Inclusive:** Adhere to WCAG accessibility standards to ensure the site is usable by everyone, regardless of ability.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Discoverability:** Ensure a seamless experience for users to find relevant capabilities and research insights through intuitive navigation and powerful search.
- **Performance:** Optimize for fast loading times and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth experience even for data-intensive tools.
- **Interactivity:** Interactive tools (like the Quick Check) should be engaging and provide immediate, valuable feedback to the user.

## Brand Consistency
- **Identity:** Maintain consistent use of the DORA logo and the established brand color palette.
- **Standards:** Follow a unified style guide for terminology, formatting, and messaging to ensure a cohesive voice across the entire platform.
