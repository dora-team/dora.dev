<p>Transformational leaders inspire and motivate followers to perform by appealing to their values and sense of purpose, facilitating wide-scale organizational change. These leaders encourage their teams to work towards a common goal through their vision, values, communication, and example-setting, and through caring about their followers&rsquo; needs.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/19462.pdf">measure of transformational leadership</a> includes five dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vision</strong>. Has a clear concept of where the organization is going and where it should be in five years.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspirational communication</strong>. Communicates in a way that inspires and motivates, even in an uncertain or changing environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Intellectual stimulation</strong>. Challenges followers to think about problems in new ways.</li>
  <li><strong>Supportive leadership</strong>. Demonstrates care and consideration of followers&rsquo; needs and feelings.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal recognition</strong>. Praises and acknowledges achievement of goals and improvements in work quality; personally compliments others when they do outstanding work.</li>
</ul>
