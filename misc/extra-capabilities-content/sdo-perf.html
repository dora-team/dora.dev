<p>Organizations increasingly rely on their ability to deliver and operate software systems to achieve their goals. To compare performance on this key outcome metric, the industry needs a way to measure the effectiveness of their development and delivery practices. Over the last six years <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops">DORA</a> has developed and validated four metrics that provide a high-level systems view of software delivery and performance and predict <a onclick="linkTo('org-perf');">an organization’s ability to achieve its goals</a>. In 2018, we added an additional metric focused on operational capabilities, and found that this measure helps organizations deliver superior outcomes. We call these five measures <strong>software delivery and operational (SDO) performance</strong>, which focuses on system-level outcomes. This focus helps you avoid the common pitfalls of software metrics, which often pit different functions against each other, resulting in local optimizations at the cost of overall outcomes.</p>


<img alt="Five metrics: lead time, deploy frequency, change fail rate, time to restore, reliability." src="/images/key_metrics_2021.png" style="width:100%" />

<p>The first four metrics can be summarized in terms of throughput and stability. We measure the throughput of the software delivery process using lead time of code changes from check-in to release along with deployment frequency. Stability is measured using time to restore—the time it takes from detecting a user-impacting incident to having it remediated—and change fail rate, a measure of the quality of the release process. You can use our <a href="https://devops-research.com/quickcheck.html">Quick Check tool</a> see how you're doing and compare yourself against the industry.</p>

<p>Many professionals approach these metrics as representing a set of trade-offs. They believe that increasing throughput will negatively impact the reliability of the software delivery process and the availability of services. For six years in a row, however, our research has consistently shown that speed and stability are outcomes that enable each other. High performers do significantly better on all four measures, and low performers do significantly worse.</p>

<p>Reliability is also important for operational performance. Prior to 2021, we used the term “availability” to describe this ability. Starting in 2021, “reliability” is used, to more broadly reflect operational goals including latency, performance, and scalability.</p>

<p>At a high level, reliability represents the ability of technology teams and organizations to keep promises and assertions about the software they are operating. Notably, reliability is about ensuring a product or service is available to and accessible by your end users. Reliability reflects how well teams define their reliability targets, track their current reliability, and learn from any outages, making sure their feedback loops are complete. Better software delivery goes hand-in-hand with higher reliability. Analysis shows that reliability measures correlate significantly with software delivery performance profiles, and high performers consistently reported superior reliability.</a></p>
