<p>These three capabilities are closely related. Research from the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2018.pdf">2018 State of DevOps Report</a>, which has more detail on each of these capabilities, shows that autonomy drives trust, voice, and <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery and operational performance</a>. Trust and voice, in turn, drive <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">Westrum organizational culture</a>. These relationships are shown in the diagram below.</p>

<h3 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--three">Autonomy</h2>

<p>In autonomous teams, leaders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish and communicate goals, but let the team decide how to do the work.</li>
  <li>Remove roadblocks by keeping rules simple.</li>
  <li>Let the team change rules if the rules are obstacles to meeting goals.</li>
  <li>Let the team prioritize good outcomes for customers, even if it means bending the rules.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h-has-bottom-margin">Giving teams more autonomy drives <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a> and leads to feelings of trust and voice, which in turn have all been shown to drive <a onclick="linkTo('culture')">organizational culture</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--three">Trust</h2>

<p>Trust reflects how much a person believes their leader or manager is honest, has good motives and intentions, and treats them fairly.</p>

<p class="h-has-bottom-margin">Trust positively affects voice and <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a>, and is driven by giving your teams more autonomy.</p>

<h3 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--three">Voice</h2>

<p>Voice is how strongly someone feels about their ability and their team's ability to speak up, especially during conflict&mdash;for example, when team members disagree, when there are system failures or risks, and when they suggest ideas to improve work.</p>

<p>Voice positively affects <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a>, and is driven by giving your teams more autonomy and trust.</p>
