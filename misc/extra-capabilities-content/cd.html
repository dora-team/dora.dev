<p>Teams can be said to have implemented continuous delivery when they have achieved the following outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams can deploy to production (or to end users) on demand, throughout the software delivery lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Fast feedback on the quality and deployability of the system is available to everyone on the team, and people make acting on this feedback their highest priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuous delivery requires the implementation of a number of <a onclick="linkTo('tech-practices');">technical practices</a> including continuous integration, trunk-based development, the comprehensive use of version control, and continuous testing.</p>

<p>In turn, continuous delivery drives a number of outcomes: higher <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a>, better <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a>, less <a onclick="linkTo('rework');">rework</a>, lower <a onclick="linkTo('deploy-pain');">deployment pain</a>, and less <a onclick="linkTo('burnout');">burnout</a>.
