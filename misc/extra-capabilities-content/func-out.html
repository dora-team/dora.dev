<p>A popular outsourcing model is to assign individual organization functions&mdash;for example, application development, testing/QA, or service operation&mdash;to external vendors. However this model introduces additional handoffs and potential friction between functional groups. The functional division of responsibilities can also inhibit agility: Once contracts have been signed, changes to specifications are difficult to manage across external silos.</p>

<p>Outsourcing tends to lead to batching work&mdash;and thus long lead times&mdash;because the transaction cost of taking work from development to QA to operations is so high when these functions are held in outsourced groups. When work is batched into projects or releases, high-value and low-value features get lumped together into each release, meaning that all of the work&mdash;whether high or low value&mdash;is delivered at the same speed.</p>

<p>The use of functional outsourcing drives lower levels of <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a>. In our <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2018.pdf">2018 State of DevOps research</a> we found that low-performing teams are 3.9 times more likely to use functional outsourcing than elite performance teams. Meanwhile, elite performance teams are twice as likely to be developing and delivering software in a single, cross-functional team.</a></p>
