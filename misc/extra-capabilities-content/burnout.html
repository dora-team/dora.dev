<p>Burnout is physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion caused by overwork or stress. But it&rsquo;s more than just being overworked or stressed. Burnout can make the things we once loved about our work and life seem insignificant and dull. It often manifests itself as a feeling of helplessness, and is correlated with pathological cultures and unproductive, wasteful work. Dr Christina Maslach, professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18457483">a pioneering researcher on job burnout</a>, found six organizational risk factors that predict burnout:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Work overload</strong>. Job demands that exceed human limits.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of control</strong>. Inability to influence decisions that affect your job.</li>
  <li><strong>Insufficient rewards</strong>. Insufficient financial, institutional, or social rewards.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakdown of community</strong>. Unsupportive workplace environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Absence of fairness</strong>. Lack of fairness in decision-making processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Value conflicts</strong>. Mismatch in organizational values and the individual&rsquo;s values.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maslach found that most organizations try to fix the person and ignore the work environment, even though data shows that fixing the environment has a higher likelihood of success. Management has the power to change all of these risk factors.</p>
