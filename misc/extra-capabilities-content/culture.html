<p>Culture and work environment encompasses several capabilities and outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-learning-culture"><strong>Climate for Learning</strong></a>. An organization with a climate for learning views learning as an investment that is needed for growth, not as a necessary evil, undertaken only when required.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture"><strong>Westrum Organizational Culture</strong></a>. This model of organizational culture was developed by sociologist Dr Ron Westrum. It classifies organizations as <em>pathological</em>, <em>bureaucratic</em>, or <em>generative</em> based on levels of cooperation, how problems are surfaced, the extent to which the organization is siloed, and how people react to failure and novelty.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/"><strong>Culture of Psychological Safety</strong></a>. In teams with a culture of psychological safety, team members trust each other, are able to resolve conflict, take calculated and moderate risks, speak up, and are more creative.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-job-satisfaction"><strong>Job Satisfaction</strong></a>. People feel supported by their employers, have the tools and resources to do their work, and feel their judgement is valued.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25148670"><strong>Identity</strong></a>. Employees identify with the organization they work for. They say that the organization is a good place to work. They feel that the organization cares about them. And they&rsquo;re willing to put in extra effort to help the organization succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>These cultural and environmental factors impact both <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery</a> and <a onclick="linkTo('org-perf');">organizational performance</a>. In turn, teams can develop these outcomes by implementing the technical, cultural, and management capabilities discussed in our research model. These capabilities include <a onclick="linkTo('cd');">continuous delivery</a>, <a onclick="linkTo('lean-product');">lean product development</a>, <a onclick="linkTo('lean-management');">lean management practices</a>, and others.</p>
