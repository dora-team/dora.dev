<!--
    In this Hugo partial, we take one REQUIRED variable [.].
    Based upon the received value we use Hugo `resources.Get` function
    to obtain a reference to the CSS file from within the assets directory and
    pass into the 'ToCSS' pipe to transpile Sass to CSS using the LibSass
    transpiler included in Hugoâ€™s extended edition.

    Example:
    Given the following Layout or top level partial:
            partial "link_styles" "scss/homepage.scss"

        This, this partial will receive '.' as `scss/main.scss`.  Then, this partial
            will apply the href to the Hugo transpiled version of the file
            reference `assets/scss/main.scss` to something like the following:

            href="/scss/main.{ramdom-hash}.css"

    [NOTE] This partial does NOT support the Options argument for Hugo's toCSS.
        To support options, you would need to refactor the Layouts to pass in a
        Dictionary object.

        e.g.,  partial "link_styles" (dict "scss" "scss/main.scss")

        then in this file:
            1) add a default for options:  $options := .options | default ""
            2) Set the styles pipeline to $styles := resources.Get .scss | toCSS $options | fingerprint

{{ $scss := . }}
{{ $options := "" }}
{{ $styles := resources.Get $scss | toCSS $options | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}" integrity="{{ $styles.Data.Integrity }}">
