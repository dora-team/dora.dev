![DORA](DORA-Horizontal-Logo.svg)

DORA's current brand was launched in October of 2024 along with the [2024 DORA Report](/research/2024/dora-report/). As part of this rebranding, we have also "de-acronymed" DORA. DORA is the brand name and it is not an acronym for anything, it should always be written in CAPITAL LETTERS. "DORA" is correct, other casing, such as "Dora" or "dora" are incorrect and should not be used.

## Branding Guidelines
