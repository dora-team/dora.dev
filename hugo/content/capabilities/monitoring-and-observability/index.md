Note: *Monitoring and observability* is one of a set of capabilities that
drive higher software delivery and organizational performance. These
capabilities were discovered by the
[DORA State of DevOps research program](/),
an independent, academically rigorous investigation into the practices and
capabilities that drive high performance. To learn more, read our
[DevOps resources](https://cloud.google.com/devops).

Good monitoring is a staple of high-performing teams.
[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://cloud.google.com/devops)
[research](publications/pdf/state-of-devops-2018.pdf)
shows that a comprehensive monitoring and observability solution, along with a
number of other technical practices, positively contributes to
[continuous delivery.](/capabilities/continuous-delivery)

DORA's research defined these terms as follows:

**Monitoring** is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to watch
and understand the state of their systems. Monitoring is based on gathering
predefined sets of metrics or logs.

**Observability** is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to
actively debug their system. Observability is based on exploring properties and
patterns not defined in advance.

To do a good job with monitoring and observability, your teams should have the
following:

-   Reporting on the overall health of systems (Are my systems functioning?
    Do my systems have sufficient resources available?).
-   Reporting on system state as experienced by customers (Do my customers
    know if my system is down and have a bad experience?).
-   Monitoring for key business and systems metrics.
-   Tooling to help you understand and debug your systems in production.
-   Tooling to find information about things you did not previously know
    (that is, you can identify *unknown unknowns*).
-   Access to tools and data that help trace, understand, and diagnose
    infrastructure problems in your production environment, including
    interactions between services.

## How to implement monitoring and observability

Monitoring and observability solutions are designed to do the following:

-   Provide leading indicators of an outage or service degradation.
-   Detect outages, service degradations, bugs, and unauthorized activity.
-   Help debug outages, service degradations, bugs, and unauthorized activity.
-   Identify long-term trends for capacity planning and business purposes.
-   Expose unexpected side effects of changes or added functionality.

As with all DevOps capabilities, installing a tool is not enough to achieve the
objectives, but tools can help or hinder the effort.  Monitoring systems should
not be confined to a single individual or team within an organization.
Empowering all developers to be proficient with monitoring helps develop a
culture of data-driven decision making and improves overall system
debuggability, reducing outages.

There are a few keys to effective implementation of monitoring and
observability. First, your monitoring should tell you what is broken and help
you understand why, before too much damage is done. The key metric in the event
of an outage or service degradation is time-to-restore (TTR). A key contributor
to TTR is the ability to rapidly understand what broke and the quickest path to
restoring service (which may not involve immediately remediating the underlying
problems).

There are two high-level ways of looking at a system: *blackbox* monitoring,
where the system's internal state and mechanisms are not made known, and
*whitebox* monitoring, where they are.

For more information, see "Monitoring Distributed Systems" in the
[Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/)
book.

### Blackbox monitoring

In a blackbox (or *synthetic*) monitoring system, input is sent to the system
under examination in the same way a customer might. This might take the form of
HTTP calls to a public API, or RPC calls to an exposed endpoint, or it might be
calling for an entire web page to be rendered as a part of the monitoring
process.

Blackbox monitoring is a sampling-based method. The same system that is
responsible for user requests is monitored by the blackbox system. A blackbox
system can also provide coverage of the target system's surface area.  This
could mean probing each external API method. You might also consider a
representative mixture of requests to better mimic actual customer behavior.
For example, you might perform 100 reads and only 1 write of a given API.

You can govern this process with a *scheduling system*, to ensure that these
inputs are made at a sufficient rate in order to gain confidence in their
sampling. Your system should also contain a *validation engine*, which can be
as simple as checking response codes, or matching output with regular
expressions, up to rendering a dynamic site in a headless browser and traversing
its DOM tree, looking for specific elements. After a decision is made (pass,
fail) on a given probe, you must store the result and metadata for reporting and
alerting purposes.  Examining a snapshot of a failure and its context can be
invaluable for diagnosing an issue.

### Whitebox monitoring

Monitoring and observability rely on signals sent from the workload under
scrutiny into the monitoring system. This can generally take the form of the
three most common components: *metrics*, *logs*, and *traces*. Some
monitoring systems also track and report *events*, which can represent user
interactions with an entire system, or state changes within the system itself.

*Metrics* are simply measurements taken inside a system, representing the
state of that system in a measurable way. These are almost always numeric and
tend to take the form of counters, distributions, and gauges. There are some
cases where string metrics make sense, but generally numeric metrics are used
due to the need to perform mathematical calculations on them to form statistics
and draw visualizations.

*Logs* can be thought of as append-only files that represent the state of a
single thread of work at a single point in time. These logs can be a single
string like "User pushed button X" or a structured log entry which includes
metadata such as the time the event happened, what server was processing it, and
other environmental elements.  Sometimes a system which cannot write structured
logs will produce a semi-structured string like `[timestamp] [server] message
[code]` which can be parsed after the fact, as needed. Log entries tend to be
written using a client library like log4j, structlog, bunyan, log4net, or Nlog.
Log processing can be a very reliable method of producing statistics that
can be considered trustworthy, as they can be reprocessed based on immutable
stored logs, even if the log processing system itself is buggy. Additionally,
logs can be processed in real time to produce *log-based metrics*.

*Traces* are composed of *spans*, which are used to follow an event or user
action through a distributed system. A span can show the path of a request
through one server, while another span might run in parallel, both having the
same parent span. These together form a trace, which is often visualized in a
waterfall graph similar to those used in profiling tools. This lets developers
understand time taken in a system, across many servers, queues, and network
hops. A common framework for this is
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/),
which was formed from both
[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/)
and
[OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/).

Metrics, logs, and traces can be reported to the monitoring system by the
server under measurement, or by an adjacent *agent* that can witness or infer
things about the system.

### Instrumentation

To make use of a monitoring system, your system must be *instrumented*. That
is, code must be added to a system in order to expose its inner state. For
example, if a simple program contains a pool of connections to another service,
you might want to keep track of the size of that pool and the number of unused
connections at any given time. In order to do so, a developer must write some
code in the connection pool logic to keep track of when connections are formed
or destroyed, when they are handed out, and when they are returned. This might
take the form of log entries or events for each of these, or you might increment
and decrement a gauge for the size of the queue, or you might increment a
counter each time a connection is created, or each time a pool is expanded.

### Correlation

Metrics can be collected from the application, as well as from its underlying
systems, such as the JVM, guest OS, hypervisor, node OS, and the hardware
itself. Note that as you go further down in a stack, you might start conflating
metrics that are shared across workloads. For example, if a single machine
serves several applications, watching the disk usage might not correspond
directly to the system under observation. Correlating issues across applications
on a shared system, however, can help you pin down a contributing factor (such
as a slow disk). Drilling down from a single application to its underlying
system metrics, then pulling up to show all similarly affected applications can
be very powerful.

Measuring a distributed system means having observability in many places and
being able to view them all together. This might mean both a frontend and its
database, or it might mean a mobile application running on a customer's device,
a cloud load balancer, and a set of microservices. Being able to connect data
from all of these sources in one place is a fundamental requirement in modern
observability tools.

### Computation

After you collect data from various sources for your system, you generate
statistics and aggregate data across various realms. This might be cohorts of
users, regions of your compute footprint, or geographic locations of your
customers. Being able to develop these statistics on-the-fly based on raw
events is very advantageous but can be costly both in terms of storage as well
as real-time compute capacity required.

When you choose your tooling and plan your instrumentation, you must consider
cardinality and dimensionality. These two aspects of metric collection can
greatly affect your ability to scale your ability to observe a system.

*Cardinality* is the measure of distinct values in a system. For example, a
field like `cpu-utilization` tends to need a range between 0 and 100. However,
if you keep track of a user's unique identifier, they're all distinct, thus if
you have 1M users, you have a cardinality of 1M. This makes a huge
difference.

*Dimensionality* is the ability to record more than just a single value along
with a timestamp, as you might have in a simple timeseries database that backs a
monitoring system. Simply recording the value of a counter, for example
requests-sent, might initially record just the value of the number of requests
sent up to this point in time like ``. However, as with
structured logs, you might want to also record some environmental data,
resulting in something like: `{time=x, value=y, server=foo, cluster=123,
environment=prod, service=bar}`. Combining high cardinality and high
dimensionality can result in dramatically increased compute and storage
requirements, to the point where monitoring might not work as expected!  This
needs to be understood by developers who write dynamically generated data and
metadata into monitoring systems.

### Learning and improving

Part of operating a system is learning from outages and mistakes. The process
of writing retrospectives or postmortems with corrective actions is well
documented. One outcome of this process is the development of improved
monitoring. It is critical to a fast-moving organization to allow their
monitoring systems to be updated quickly and efficiently by anyone within the
organization. Monitoring configuration is critical, so changes should be
tracked by means of
[review and approval](/capabilities/streamlining-change-approval),
just as with code development and delivery. Keeping your monitoring
configuration in a
[version control system](/capabilities/version-control)
is a good first step in allowing broad access to the system, while maintaining
control on this critical part of your system. Developing automation around
deploying monitoring configuration through an automation pipeline can also
improve your ability to ensure these configurations are valid and applied
consistently. After you treat your monitoring configuration as code, these
improvements can all be accomplished by means of a
[deployment automation](/capabilities/deployment-automation)
process, ideally the same system used by the rest of your team.

## Common pitfalls of implementing monitoring and observability

When developing a system for monitoring and observability for your
organization, you should be aware that there generally isn't a simple
plug-and-play solution. Any decent monitoring system will require a deep
understanding of each component that you want to measure, as well as direct
manipulation of the code to instrument those systems. Avoid having a single
monitoring person or dedicated team who is solely
responsible for the system. This will not only help you prevent a single point
of failure, but also increase your ability to understand and improve your system
as an entire organization. Monitoring and observability needs to be built into
the baseline knowledge of all your developers. A common pitfall here is for
the operation team, NOC, or other similar team to be the only ones allowed to
make changes to a monitoring system. This should be avoided and replaced with a
system that follows CD patterns.

A common anti-pattern in writing alerts in monitoring systems is to attempt to
enumerate all possible error conditions and write an alert for each of them. We
call this *cause-based alerting,* and you should avoid it as much as possible.
Instead, you should focus on *symptom-based alerting,* which only alerts you when
a user-facing symptom is visible or is predicted to arise soon. You should still
be able to observe non-user-facing systems, but they shouldn't be directly
alerting on-call engineers if there are no user-facing symptoms. Note that the
term *user-facing* can also include users internal to your organization.

When generating alerts, you should consider how they are delivered. Your alerts
should have multiple pathways to oncall engineers, including but not limited to:
SMS delivery, dedicated mobile apps, automated phone calls, or email. A common
pitfall is to email alerts to an entire team via an email distribution list.
This can quickly result in ignored alerts due to
[diffusion of responsibility](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). Another common
failure is simply a poor
[signal-to-noise ratio](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio).
If too many alerts are not actionable, or result in no improvement, the team
will easily miss those alerts that are meaningful and possibly very important, a
problem known as
[alarm fatigue](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue).
Any method to silence or suppress some set of alerts should be tracked very
carefully to ensure it is not too broad or applied too often.

When building monitoring dashboards to visualize metrics, a common mistake is
to spend a long time curating the "Perfect Dashboard". This is similar to the
cause-based alerting mistake above. In a high-functioning team, the system
under observation changes so fast that any time spent curating a dashboard will
be out of date before it is done. Instead, focusing on the ability for team
members to quickly create a dashboard or other set of visualizations that fits
their needs is important.

Failing to separate out product or executive-facing metrics such as user
acquisition rate and revenue tracking away from operational or service health
dashboards is also a common problem, as they are both very important, but
distinct. Keeping these separate is highly recommended.

## How to measure monitoring and observability

When implementing a monitoring and observability system in your organization,
you can track some internal metrics to see how well you're doing.  Here are some
that you might wish to track with a monthly survey, or possibly by automatically
analyzing your postmortems or alerting logs.

-   **Changes made to monitoring configuration.** How many pull requests or changes
    per week are made to the repository containing the monitoring
    configuration? How often are these changes pushed to the monitoring
    system? (Daily? Batched? Immediately on PR?)
-   **"Out of hours" alerts.** What percentage of alerts are handled at
    night? While some global businesses have a follow-the-sun support model
    which makes this a non-issue, it can be an indication that not enough
    attention has been paid to leading indicators of failures. Regular night-time
    alerts can lead to alert fatigue and burned-out teams.
-   **Team alerting balance.** If you have teams in different locations responsible for
    a service, are alerts fairly distributed and addressed by all teams?  If
    not, why?
-   **False positives.** How many alerts resulted in no action, or were
    marked as "Working as Intended"? Alerts which aren't actionable and which
    haven't helped you predict failures should be deleted.
-   **False negatives.** How many system failures happened with no alerting,
    or alerting later than expected? How often do your postmortems include
    adding new (symptom-based) alerts?
-   **Alert creation.** How many alerts are created per week (total, or
    grouped by severity, team, etc.)?
-   **Alert acknowledgement.** What percentage of alerts are acknowledged
    within the agreed deadline (such as 5 minutes, 30 minutes)? Sometimes
    this is coupled with or can be tracked by a metric like *alert
    fall-through* when a secondary oncall person is notified for an alert.
-   **Alert silencing and silence duration.** How many alerts are in a
    silenced or suppressed state per week?  How many are added to this pool,
    how many removed?  If your alert silencing has an expiration system, how
    many silences are extended to last longer than initially expected?  What is
    the mean and maximum silence period? (A fun one is "how many silences are
    effectively 'infinite'"?)
-   **Unactionable alerts.** What percentage of alerts were considered
    "unactionable"? That is, the engineer alerted was not able to immediately
    take some action, either out of an inability to understand the alert
    implication, or due to a known issue. Unactionable alerts are a well known
    source of
    [toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/).
-   **Usability: alerts, runbooks, dashboards.** How many graphs are on your
    dashboards? How many lines per graph? Can teams understand the graphs?
    Is there explanatory text to help out new engineers? Do people have to
    scroll and browse a lot to find the information they need? Can engineers
    navigate from alert to playbook to dashboards effectively? Are the alerts
    named in such a way to point engineers in the right direction? These might
    be measured by surveys of the team, over time.
-   **MTTD, MTTR, impact**. The bottom line is time to detect, time to
    resolve, and impact. Consider measuring the "area under the curve" of the
    time that the outage was affecting customers times the number of customers affected.
    This can be estimated or done more precisely with tooling.

By tracking some or all of these metrics, you'll start to gain a better
understanding of how well your monitoring and observability systems are working
for your organization. Breaking these measurements down by product, by
operational team, or other methods will give you insight not only into the
health of your products but also your processes and your people.
