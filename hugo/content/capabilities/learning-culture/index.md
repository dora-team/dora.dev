summary: "A culture’s attitudes towards learning and if it is valued. For example, is learning considered essential for continued progress? Is learning thought of as a cost, or an investment? This is a measure of an organization’s learning culture."

<!-- TODO: Add NOTE banner to the below section -->
Note: *Learning culture* is one of a set of capabilities that drive higher
software delivery and organizational performance.  These capabilities were
discovered by the
[DORA State of DevOps research program](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html),
an independent, academically rigorous investigation into the practices and
capabilities that drive high performance. To learn more, read our
[DevOps resources](https://cloud.google.com/devops).

Research from the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2014.pdf)
(PDF) team shows that an
organizational culture that values learning contributes to
software delivery performance with the following:

-   Increased deployment frequency
-   Reduced lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure rate
-   Strong team culture

The climate for learning in your organization is directly related to the extent
to which your organization treats learning as strategic:

-  Does your organization
    view learning as an investment necessary for growth?
-  Is learning seen as a necessary burden, undertaken only grudgingly?
-  Is learning completely avoided?

Research done in other areas, such as accounting, has also shown that a climate
for learning is predictive of performance gains.

## How to implement a learning culture

You can help your organization create a climate for learning by viewing
learning as the key to improvement and as an investment. Some steps you can take
 to directly support learning include:

-   **Create a training budget, and advocate for it internally.** Emphasize
    how much the organization values a climate of learning by putting resources
    behind formal education opportunities.
-   **Ensure that your team has the resources to engage in informal
    learning and the space to explore ideas.** Learning often happens outside
    of formal education. Some companies, like 3M and Google, set aside a
    portion of time for focused
    free-thinking and exploration of side projects.
-   **Make it safe to fail.** If failure is punished, people won't try new
    things. Treat failures as opportunities to learn, and hold blameless
    post-mortems to work out how to improve processes and systems. Help people
    feel comfortable taking reasonable risks, and create a culture of innovation.
-   **Create opportunities and spaces to share information.** Whether you
    hold weekly lightning talks or offer resources for monthly
    lunch-and-learns, set up a regular cadence of opportunities for employees
    to share their knowledge.
-   **Make resources available for continued education.** For example,
    attending conferences is important for both exposure to new technology and
    case studies, as well as networking with peers.

## Ways to improve your learning culture

Continuing to build a climate for learning is directly related to how an
organization encourages and invests in learning. Here are some ways an
organization can show that learning is important and necessary for growth:

-   **Have regular lunchtime meetings ("brownbags") where one person
    presents about a project they are working on in a new tech, or something
    they are investigating.** Rotate the presentations among team members and
    reward people for presenting.
-   **When people attend conferences, have them share the new ideas through
    presentations or trip reports.** You can even host regular meetups or
    mini-conferences to increase networking and exposure to new technologies
    and ideas.
-   **Encourage people to get certifications or external trainings.** You
    can help with this by covering costs of external trainings and forming
    study groups that are a part of normal work activity.

## Ways to measure learning culture

The most effective way to measure your climate for learning is to survey
your employees. Use well-designed items and constructs that are rigorous and
show good
[psychometric properties](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics)
of
[discriminant](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant_validity)
and
[convergent](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_validity)
validity and
reliability (all statistical measures). The goal is for teams to feel that
learning is encouraged and supported throughout the organization.

Research presented in the article
[An empirical analysis of the levers of control framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368207000049)
shows that you can measure learning culture based on the extent to which people
agree or disagree with the following statements about their organization:

-   Learning is the key to improvement.
-   Once we quit learning we endanger our future.
-   Learning is viewed as an investment, not an expense.

Research from DORA shows that a climate for learning is a significant predictor
of software delivery performance as well as organizational performance. Other
studies show that climate for learning is predictive of organizational
performance, so investments in learning, and a culture that values learning, is
a good bet for organizations.
