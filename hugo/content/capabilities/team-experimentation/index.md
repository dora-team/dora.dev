Note: *Team experimentation* is one of a set of capabilities that drive
higher software delivery and organizational performance. These
capabilities were discovered by the
[DORA State of DevOps research program](/),
an independent, academically rigorous investigation into the practices and
capabilities that drive high performance. To learn more, read our
[DevOps resources](https://cloud.google.com/devops).

Even in many so-called agile teams, developers can only work on requirements or
stories that are given to them. And despite the developers’ specialist
knowledge, or what they discover in the development process, they can’t change
those requirements and stories. In truly agile teams, what’s written on the
story card is a reminder of a conversation between customers and the team.
Stories start from the business outcome that they are trying to achieve or the
problem they are trying to solve. Teams then decide on what needs to be done,
and test whether it will achieve the outcome or solve the problem.

For your organization to fully benefit from modern software development
techniques, you must empower your teams to experiment with real users to
achieve agreed-upon business outcomes. In this paradigm, developers can quickly
prototype and test ideas as they discover more about users and about the problem,
and design solutions. Teams then incorporate what they learned into the design of
the product or service. Using the lean product management method, these
practices help teams ship features that add value to the organization, and ship
those features more frequently.

Team experimentation is part of lean product management. This approach is often
used in combination with capabilities like
[visibility of work in the value stream](/capabilities/work-visibility-in-value-stream),
[working in small batches](/capabilities/working-in-small-batches),
and [visibility into customer feedback](/capabilities/customer-feedback).
These capabilities predict software delivery performance and organizational
performance.

## How to implement team experimentation

[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) research](https://cloud.google.com/devops)
identifies three key components to team experimentation that drive software
delivery performance:

-   The ability to work on new ideas independently, without having to get
    permission from outside of the team.
-   The ability to write and change specifications during development.
-   The ability to make changes to stories and specifications without having
    to get permission from outside of the team.

Based on these abilities, the following practices can help improve your team
experimentation:

-   **Empower teams**. Empower teams and allow them to work on new ideas in
    pursuit of business goals that solve important problems.
-   **Provide information and context**. Providing teams with information and
    context lets teams make informed decisions about the right work to do.
    Measuring organizational outcomes provides information critical to making
    the best decisions, so teams are able to achieve expected outcomes and solve
    problems.
-   **Leave the details to those doing the work**. Allow your teams to change
    stories, specifications, and technologies when they decide it's appropriate.
    Understand and acknowledge that they are the experts, and empower them to
    make the technical decisions necessary to get the work done. In the
    highest-performing teams and organizations, teams are allowed
    [to make informed decisions about the tools and technologies they use](/capabilities/teams-empowered-to-choose-tools).

## Common pitfalls in team experimentation

When organizations implement team experimentation, they often face these common
pitfalls:

-   **Ignoring the importance of experimentation altogether**. Don't treat
    your technical staff as order-takers. It's worse when teams are given
    specific direction on how to perform the work. Your technical staff are the
    experts, so empower them to make the technical decisions needed to get the
    work done.
-   **Not providing opportunities or time for your technical staff to design
    and conduct experiments in quick and easy ways**. Empower your developers
    to quickly prototype and test ideas.

## Ways to improve team experimentation

To free your teams to find the best solutions, try some of these suggestions:

-   **Hold regular hackathons**. Hackathons are opportunities for the team
    to experiment and to work with and share ideas. They also have the added
    benefit of letting your team work with new technologies and tools.
-   **Encourage teams to iterate on and continually improve solutions to
    foster experimentation**. Many times the first solution to a problem isn't
    the best. Improvements to one service or feature often yield improvements
    in others.
-   **Allow developers and operators to talk to and observe customers**.
    This kind of interaction provides more context and information that teams
    can use to solve problems and develop new ideas.

## Ways to measure team experimentation

You might be able to capture some evidence of team experimentation in your
systems, for example, by tracking permission requests for changing stories or
specifications. However, we recommend using surveys to measure experimentation.
The core idea is that teams feel the freedom to do this work and find the best
ways to solve problems.

DORA research shows that high-performance teams are driven by the following
measures:

-   Teams are able to work on new ideas.
-   Teams are able to do work without having to ask for permission.
-   Teams are able to make changes to stories and specifications during
    development.
-   Teams are able to make changes without having to ask for permission.
