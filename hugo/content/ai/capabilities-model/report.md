<p>
  The DORA AI Capabilities Model report is a companion to the 
  <a href="/research/2025/dora-report">2025 State of AI-assisted Software Development report</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This report moves beyond the “what” and “why” to provide actionable guidance on the “how.” For
  each of the seven core capabilities, this report details implementation strategies, specific
  tactics for teams to get started, and methods for monitoring progress and fostering continuous
  improvement. The goal is to equip technology leaders and practitioners with the knowledge to 
  build an organizational environment where the transformative potential of AI in software
  development can be fully realized.
