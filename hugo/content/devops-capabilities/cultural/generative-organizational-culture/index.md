headline: "Discover how growing a generative, high-trust culture drives better organizational and software delivery performance."
summary: "Measure of organizational culture is based on a typology developed by Ron Westrum, a sociologist who studied safety-critical complex systems in the domains of aviation and healthcare. Our own research has found that this measure of culture is predictive of IT Performance, organizational performance, and decreasing burnout. Hallmarks of this include good information flow, high cooperation and trust, bridging between teams, and embracing novel solutions."

According to research by [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://dora.dev), organizational
culture that is high-trust and emphasizes information flow is predictive of
software delivery performance and organizational performance in technology. The
idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good
outcomes is not a new idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron
Westrum. Westrum's
[research](http://bmj.co/1BRGh5q)
included human factors in system safety, particularly in the context of
accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.

In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such
a culture influences the way information flows through an organization. Westrum
provides three characteristics of good information:

1.  It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
1.  It is timely.
1.  It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively.

In his research, he developed the following typology of organizational cultures.

| Pathological                  | Bureaucratic              | Generative                |
| :---                          | :---                      | :---                      |
| Power oriented                | Rule oriented             | Performance oriented      |
| Low cooperation               | Modest cooperation        | High cooperation          |
| Messengers "shot"             | Messengers neglected      | Messengers trained        |
| Responsibilities shirked      | Narrow responsibilities   | Risks are shared          |
| Bridging discouraged          | Bridging tolerated        | Bridging encouraged       |
| Failure leads to scapegoating | Failure leads to justice  | Failure leads to inquiry  |
| Novelty crushed               | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented       |

Similar to Dr. Westrum's findings, DORA research shows that a high-trust,
generative culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance in
technology.

Research from
[a large two-year study at Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)
found similar results: that high performing teams need a culture of trust and
[psychological safety](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/foster-psychological-safety/),
meaningful work, and clarity. In the
[2019 State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf)
further analysis shows that a culture of psychological safety is predictive of
software delivery performance, organizational performance, and productivity.

## How to implement organizational culture

DORA research shows that changing the way people work changes culture; this is
echoed in the work of John Shook, who spoke of his experiences in transforming
culture: "The way to change culture is not to first change how people think, but
instead to start by changing how people behave—what they do." This is seen in
the technical, lean, and product management capabilities they have researched
that influence culture.

In addition, teams can identify helpful practices to create a generative culture
that fosters information flow and trust by examining the six aspects of
Westrum's model of organizational culture, focusing on those behaviors seen in
the generative culture:

-   High cooperation.
-   Messengers are trained.
-   Risks are shared.
-   Bridging is encouraged.
-   Failure leads to inquiry.
-   Novelty is implemented.

Based on these aspects, here are some practices you can implement to improve
your culture:

-   **High cooperation**. Create cross-functional teams that include
    representatives from each functional area of the software delivery process
    (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, ops, security, and so
    on). This practice lets everyone share the responsibility for building,
    deploying, and maintaining a product. It's also important that there is good
    cooperation within the team.
-   **Train the messengers**. This means we want people to bring us bad news so
    we can make things better. Hold blameless postmortems. By removing blame,
    you remove fear; and by removing fear, you enable teams to surface problems
    and solve them more effectively. Also create and foster an environment where
    it is safe to take smart risks and fail, so that anyone can surface problems
    at any time—even without the ceremony of a postmortem.
-   **Share risks**. Along with this, encourage shared responsibilities.
    Quality, availability, reliability and security are everyone's job. One way
    to improve the quality of your services is to ensure that developers share
    responsibility for maintaining their code in production. The improvement in
    collaboration that comes from sharing responsibility inherently reduces
    risk: The more eyes on the software delivery process, the more you'll avoid
    errors in process or planning. Automation also reduces risk, and with the
    right tool choice, can enable collaboration.
-   **Encourage bridging**. Break down silos. In addition to creating
    cross-functional teams, techniques for breaking down silos include
    co-locating ops with the dev team; including ops in planning throughout the
    software delivery lifecycle; and implementing ChatOps. Another tip is to
    identify someone in the organization whose work you don't understand (or
    whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or
    lunch. Informal discussions help foster better communication, and you may
    understand why they do what they do—and you can come up with creative
    solutions together.
-   **Let failure lead to inquiry**. Again, hold blameless postmortems. The
    response to failure shapes the culture of an organization. Blaming
    individuals for failures creates a negative culture. If instead, failures
    lead you to ask questions about what caused the failures and how you can
    keep them from happening again in the future, you've improved your technical
    system, your processes, and your culture.
-   **Implement novelty**. Encourage experimentation. Giving employees freedom
    to explore new ideas can lead to great outcomes. Some companies give
    engineers time each week for experimentation. Others host internal hack days
    or mini-conferences to share ideas and collaborate. Many new features and
    products began this way. When you release your employees from habitual
    pathways and repetitive tasks, they can generate enormous value for your
    organization. And remember that novelty isn't limited to new products and
    features. Also encourage and reward improvements in process and ideas that
    help foster collaboration.

## Common pitfalls of organizational culture

Organizational cultures with high information flow often encounter the following
pitfalls:

-   Ignoring the importance of culture altogether, and treating technical work
    as a technology and process challenge only.
-   Focusing only on local team cultures, and not reaching out to also
    understand how team cultures interact with the broader organizational
    culture.
-   Not having enough support, or appropriate support, from leaders and managers
    for the necessary culture shift and transformation.
-   Ignoring or punishing bad news. It's better to understand that failures are
    inevitable in complex systems, and treat them as opportunities to improve
    and learn.
-   Not encouraging novelty. Admiral Grace Hopper, the famed computer science
    pioneer and inventor of the compiler, once said, "The most dangerous phrase
    in the language is ‘we've always done it this way.'" Allowing and
    encouraging teams to experiment and try new things will make work better.

By focusing on the six aspects of Westrum's typology, teams and organizations
can work thoughtfully and meaningfully toward improving their culture.

## How to measure organizational culture

Organizational culture is a perceptual measure, and therefore, best measured
using survey methods. The Westrum survey measures, included here, are highly
valid and reliable statistically.

-   On my team, information is actively sought.
-   Messengers are not punished when they deliver news of failures or other bad
    news.
-   On my team, responsibilities are shared.
-   On my team, cross-functional collaboration is encouraged and rewarded.
-   On my team, failures are treated primarily as opportunities to improve the system.
-   On my team, new ideas are welcomed.

Present these measures together—unlabeled and untitled—with responses ranging
from Strongly Disagree (=1) to Neither Agree nor Disagree (=4) to Strongly Agree
(=7). They are a latent construct, which means you can average their scores to
provide a single score for your Westrum culture metric. If necessary, you can
alter the items slightly to fit your context, but we recommend doing only minor
changes in order to preserve the statistical properties.
