At Google Cloud, we are passionate about helping organizations around the world improve their software delivery and organizational performance. Through the DORA program, we provide research-backed guidance to help teams excel. This year, we've seen tremendous emphasis on the power of AI to augment human expertise and drive innovation.

We are thrilled to celebrate the success of our customers who are at the forefront of this transformation. The annual Google Cloud DORA Awards recognize customers who have demonstrated excellence in implementing DORA principles and capabilities with Google Cloud to achieve outstanding business results.

> "Wayfair learned that the biggest gains came not just from detecting failures faster, but from reducing the effort required to fix them. Embedding AI into the CI/CD loop showed that developers respond best to targeted, explainable suggestions delivered directly in the tools they already use." - **Wayfair**

This year's 13 winners have showcased achievements in leveraging technology to innovate, scale, and lead in the respective industries.
