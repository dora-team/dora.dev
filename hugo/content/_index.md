Over the past eight years, more than 33,000 professionals around the world have taken part in the Accelerate State of DevOps survey, making it the largest and longest-running research of its kind. Year after year, Accelerate State of DevOps Reports provide data-driven industry insights that examine the capabilities and practices that drive software delivery, as well as operational and organizational performance.

In 2021, more than [22 billion records were exposed](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/97046-over-22-billion-records-exposed-in-2021) because of data breaches, with several huge companies falling victim. Between that and [other malicious attacks](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack), security continues to be top of mind for organizations as they work to keep customer data safe and their businesses up and running. With this in mind, we decided to focus on security for the **[2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Report](https://bit.ly/dora-sodr)**.
