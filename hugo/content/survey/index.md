# The Accelerate State of DevOps Survey
Over the past eight years, more than 33,000 professionals around the world have taken part in the Accelerate State of DevOps survey, making it the largest and longest-running research of its kind. Year after year, [Accelerate State of DevOps Reports](/publications/) provide data-driven industry insights that examine the capabilities and practices that drive software delivery, as well as operational and organizational performance.

In addition to contributing to our collective understanding of software delivery, the survey offers practitioners a time to reflect on challenges and opportunities within their own teams.
