# The 2025 DORA Survey is coming soon

The 2025 DORA Survey is coming soon. Please join the [DORA Community](https://dora.comunity) [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/dora-community/about) to be notified when the survey opens.

### 2025 research program

Building on a decade of rigorous research and insights, including our recent explorations in the [2024 Accelerate State of DevOps Report](/research/2024/dora-report/) and the dedicated [Impact of Generative AI in Software Development Report](/research/ai/gen-ai-report/), the DORA program continues its commitment to understanding what drives success for technology-driven teams and organizations.

As the technology landscape evolves at an unprecedented pace, particularly with the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence, our upcoming research will maintain a strong focus on the critical intersection of **AI adoption and its impact on software development practices and outcomes**. We will look into how organizations are navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by AI, examining its effects on productivity, code quality, delivery performance, and the very nature of development work.

We will continue to **prioritize the human aspects of technology**. Our research will investigate the vital role of human factors, including developer experience, well-being, trust (both in technology like AI and within the organization), psychological safety, and team dynamics. Understanding how individuals and teams adapt to, interact with, and derive value from new technologies, while mitigating potential drawbacks like burnout or skill gaps, remains paramount.

Our goal remains unchanged: to provide the community with **actionable, platform-agnostic, data-driven insights** that empower teams and organizations to continuously improve and thrive amidst technological transformation. We look forward to uncovering new findings and sharing them as we collectively navigate the future of software development.
