# DORA Joins Google Cloud
##### December 20, 2018

We are super excited to announce that DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) has been acquired by Google. As part of Google Cloud, DORA will continue to create delightful experiences for developers and operators  through data-driven insights that deliver value using DevOps in the cloud.

“The best, most innovative organizations develop and deliver their software faster, more reliably, more securely, and with higher quality, standing as high performers in technology,” said Dr. Nicole Forsgren, CEO and Chief Scientist of DORA. “We are excited to join a team committed to delivering research-backed DevOps practices, and we look forward to continuing our work to understand key capabilities, measure value-driven outcomes, and optimize processes to help teams deliver their software as they move to the cloud.”

DORA’s research into what makes high performing technology teams is considered foundational in the DevOps space. We have led the largest studies on DevOps to date, and our work includes the 2018 research report [Accelerate: The State of DevOps](/publications/pdf/state-of-devops-2018.pdf) (a collaboration with [Google Cloud](https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/americas?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=paidsocial&amp;utm_campaign=FY18-Q3-americas-eventonair-onlineeventsession-er-sept12_secrets_devops&amp;utm_content=dora) and supported by over a dozen industry sponsors), and several research reports and whitepapers. A central piece of DORA’s work—[the Four Key Metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics)—was recently highlighted by ThoughtWorks Technology Radar as a technique to check the success of technology transformations. In addition, DORA’s research is highlighted in the bestselling book [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/), authored by three of DORA’s founders, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim. In addition, DORA’s assessment product has helped large organizations in all industries accelerate their technology transformations effectively and efficiently.

DORA’s leadership in the DevOps space is a natural fit for Google Cloud, as both organizations are known for our mutual commitment to the developer and operations ecosystems. DORA’s data-driven approach has helped teams leverage automation, process, and cultural change to improve the quality of their software and the quality of their work-life. Google Cloud is beloved for its contributions to the open source community, and is known for its research-driven approach to understanding how developers and operators work, and what makes them successful.

“Our focus has always been on delivering the best possible developer and operator experiences and investing in tools and workflows to make that a reality, and then making them broadly accessible to teams around the world,” said Melody Meckfessel, vice president, Engineering at Google Cloud. “We are excited for DORA to join the Google Cloud family to help strengthen our data-driven approach to understanding what makes developers and operators productive and happy.”

Many thanks to the DevOps and technical communities who have inspired us at DORA on our journey to understand what makes high performing organizations and technologists. We have loved hearing your stories of success and impact, and are excited to continue our work.
