The 2018 Accelerate State of DevOps Report identifies capabilities and practices that drive high performance in software delivery and operational performance (SDO) across all industries.

The report introduces the concept of elite performers, a subset of high performers representing the cutting edge of software delivery and operations. Compared to low performers, elite performers deploy code 46 times more frequently, have 2,555 times faster lead times for changes, 2,604 times faster time to restore service, and seven times lower change failure rates.

The key findings of the report are:

* Software delivery and operations performance unlocks competitive advantages. Those advantages include increased profitability, productivity, market share, and customer satisfaction.
* Cloud implementation matters, not just adoption: Teams leveraging essential cloud computing characteristics are 23 times more likely to be elite performers.
* Open Source fuels high performance: Elite performers are significantly more likely to extensively use and plan to expand their use of open source software components, libraries, and platforms.
* Outsourcing by function hurts performance: Outsourcing whole functions like development, testing, or operations is linked to lower performance and is rarely adopted by elite performers.
* Technical practices drive success: Continuous testing, monitoring and observability, database change management, and integrating security early in the development process are crucial for achieving high performance.
* Generative culture is essential: A culture characterized by cooperation, trust, voice, and a focus on learning leads to superior SDO performance and organizational outcomes.
* Leadership and autonomy empower teams: Teams with greater autonomy, fueled by trust in their leaders, are more likely to achieve high performance and contribute to a stronger organizational culture.
