The report emphasizes the importance of continuous delivery (CD) as a key technical practice that reduces the risk and cost of software releases. It also highlights the need for clear change management processes, recommending a shift from formal heavyweight change approvals to peer review-based approval during the development process, complemented by automation to detect, prevent, and correct potential issues early in the delivery lifecycle. Lastly, the report finds that a culture of psychological safety, trust, and respect positively contributes to both productivity and SDO performance.

Key findings include:

* Delivering software quickly, reliably, and safely is crucial for technology transformation and organizational performance, with elite performers being twice as likely to meet or exceed their performance goals.
* Cloud continues to be a differentiator for elite performers and drives high performance, with elite performers 24 times more likely than low performers to utilize all five essential cloud computing capabilities.
* Productivity can drive improvements in work/life balance and reductions in burnout, and organizations can support it by investing in tooling, information search, reducing technical debt, and fostering a culture of psychological safety.
* Scaling DevOps effectively requires structural solutions that build communities, with high performers favoring strategies such as Communities of Practice and Grassroots initiatives.



* Elite performers excel: The proportion of elite performers has almost tripled, highlighting that excellence in software delivery and organizational performance is achievable through adopting key capabilities.
* Speed and stability go hand-in-hand: High performers achieve both speed and stability in software delivery, refuting the notion that there's an inherent trade-off between the two.
* Cloud computing is a differentiator: Elite performance is closely linked to effective cloud adoption, with elite performers 24 times more likely to utilize all five essential cloud computing capabilities.
* Invest in productivity: Organizations can improve productivity by investing in tooling, facilitating information search, reducing technical debt, and fostering a culture of psychological safety. This in turn leads to improvements in work/life balance and reductions in burnout.
* Structure DevOps around communities: Scaling DevOps effectively involves building community structures, with high-performing organizations favoring strategies like Communities of Practice and Grassroots movements.
* Embrace continuous delivery: Continuous delivery remains a key technical practice that reduces risk and cost while improving software delivery performance.
* Shift left on change approvals: Organizations should move away from heavyweight external change approval processes and embrace "shift left" peer review-based approvals during the development process, supported by automation to identify and resolve issues earlier.
