**p.23** "Continuous integrations" should be "continuous integration"

**p.25** The footnote description of "Mediation" is unspecific and would benefit from an example. It should be changed to: "Mediation is a test that evaluates possible mechanisms or pathways underlying an effect. You can say, for example, 'the data supports the hypothesis that the effect of trunk-based development on software delivery performance occurs through continuous deployment (the mediator)'. Complete mediation is when the entire effect looks to be explained through the mediator. Partial mediation is when only some of the effect is explained through the mediator." _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.26** "Writing code clocks" should be "Writing code blocks"

**p.26** "Optimising code" should use the American spelling: "Optimizing"

**p.64** "Continuous intergration" should be "continuous integration"

**p.65** The description of Step 3 should read "Hypothesize about potential confounds" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.71** In the footnote, the link should have destination https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.48.6.1467 but it is incorrectly linked to https://www.zenika.com. _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.74** "Stack Overflow Developer’s survey" should be "Stack Overflow Developer Survey"

**p.77** The word “coach” is misspelled as "couch" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.78** The "number of employees" chart is sorted by value. It should be sorted by label.

**p.78** In the "number of employees" chart, the row labeled "1 to 4" should be labeled "1" 

**p.80** The graph label "% of time spend in office" should be "...spent in office"

**p.82** The word "construct" is misspelled as "contruct" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.83** The text describes a "solid black line" when in fact the lines are blue.
