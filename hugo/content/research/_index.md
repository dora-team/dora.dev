        <h3>About the DORA Core Model</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The DORA Core Model is a collection of capabilities, metrics, and outcomes that represent the most firmly-established findings from across the history and breadth of DORA’s research program. Core is derived from DORA's ongoing research, including the analyses presented in our annual <a href='#dora_research_archives' style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;">DORA Reports</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DORA Core Model is intended to be used as a guide in practitioner contexts: it deliberately trails the research, evolving more conservatively. The concepts and relationships shown in the DORA Core Model have been repeatedly demonstrated by our research, and have been successfully used by software engineering teams to prioritize continuous improvement.
