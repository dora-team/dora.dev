## Errata for the 2025 DORA Report

This page lists errors and corrections to the 2025 State of AI-assisted Software Development report. To track revisions, report PDFs are stamped with a version number. The initial version of the 2025 report is [`v.2025.1`]({{< ref "/research/2025/dora-report" >}}).

### Errata in `v.2025.1`

**p. 9** There is an extra "deployments" in "This shift helped enable 136,000 deployments deployments per day in 2015"

**p. 44** Figure 29: Estimated effect of AI adoption score scaled on key outcomes. "Existential oonnection" on the Y-axis should be "Existential connection"

**p. 46** Figure 30: Ownership. The figure does not have a key explaining the meaning of the colors.

* Light blue ![light blue color swatch](light-blue.png) is No AI.
* Dark purple ![dark purple color swatch](dark-purple.png) is AI.

**p. 97** Footnote 1 should link to [https://dora.dev/research/2025/questions](/research/2025/questions).

**p. 100** "He has studied the deployment of intelligent technologies since 2011." has an unnecessary space at the beginning of the sentence.

**p. 107** Figure 61: Programming language usage. There are a few errors in the list of programming languages:

* The list includes two entries for "C". The first should be "C#” (18.5%) and the second should be "C” (3.9%).
* It lists "C+” as a language. It should be "C++” (14.5%).

**p. 115** The description for one of the core analysis variables, `ai_adoption`, is incorrect. It should state: "`ai_adoption` = a factor made of three indicators".
