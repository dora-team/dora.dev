## Errata for the 2025 DORA Report

This page lists errors and corrections to the 2025 State of AI-assisted Software Development report. To track revisions, report PDFs are stamped with a version number. The initial version of the 2025 report was `v. 2025.1`. The latest version is [`v. 2025.2`]({{< ref "/research/2025/dora-report" >}}).

The printed version of the 2025 report has the following errata:

**p. 3** The page numbers in the table of contents are incorrect. They are all off by one, a classic error in computer science. The correct page numbers are:
  * 04: Executive summary
  * 09: Foreword
  * 12: Understanding your software delivery performance
  * 24: AI adoption and use
  * 34: Exploring AI’s relationship to key outcomes
  * 50: DORA AI Capabilities Model
  * 66: Platform engineering
  * 74: Value stream management
  * 80: The AI mirror: How AI reflects and amplifies your organization’s true capabilities
  * 90: Metrics frameworks
  * 96: Final thoughts: From insight to action
  * 98: Acknowledgements
  * 100: Authors
  * 104: Demographics and firmographics
  * 114: Methodology
  * 132: Our research model and its theory
  * 138: Next steps
  * 139: Appendix

**p. 71** In the fourth paragraph, "stabilty" should be "instability."
  * "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in stability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..." should be "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in instability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..."

### Errata in `v. 2025.2`

**p. 51** Figure 32 has an incorrect caption. The correct caption is "Figure 32: A clear and communicated AI stance determines AI’s impact on organizational performance"

**p. 70** In the fourth paragraph, "stabilty" should be "instability."
  * "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in stability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..." should be "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in instability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..."

### Errata in `v. 2025.1`

* The correct title is "A clear and communicated AI stance moderates AI’s impact on software delivery throughput"
* The correct caption is "Figure 34: A clear and communicated AI stance moderates AI’s impact on software delivery throughput"

**p. 57** Figure 38 has an incorrect title and caption. _[Corrected in `v. 2025.2`]_

* The correct title is "Version control commit frequency moderates AI’s impact on individual effectiveness"
* The correct caption is "Figure 38: Version control commit frequency moderates AI’s impact on individual effectiveness"

**p. 70** In the fourth paragraph, "stabilty" should be "instability."
  * "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in stability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..." should be "The increase in performance in spite of the increase in instability, suggests a form of risk compensation where the platform makes it fast and cheap to recover..."
