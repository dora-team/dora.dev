## A first look at the 2025 DORA research

In the world of technology, change is the only constant. For [over a decade](/decade/), the DORA research program has provided data-backed insights into the [capabilities and conditions](/research/?view=detail) required for high-performing teams and organizations. Today, a new force is reshaping our industry at an unprecedented pace: Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Leaders and practitioners are all asking the same critical questions. How does AI *really* impact our work? Is it the key to unlocking new levels of productivity, or another source of complexity and potential burnout? What practices will define high-performing, technology-driven organizations in the AI era?

Our ongoing research is designed to cut through the hype and deliver clear, actionable insights into how teams can thrive. We’re investigating the tangible connections between emerging practices and the outcomes that matter most: from developer productivity and well-being to software delivery performance, and ultimately, organizational success.

Here’s a sneak peek at some of the key areas we're exploring:

* **Harnessing the AI toolkit:** We're examining how capabilities like [AI fluency](https://www.anthropic.com/ai-fluency/overview), effective [AI policy and governance](/research/ai/trust-in-ai/#five-strategies-for-fostering-developers-trust-in-gen-ai), and more impact team performance.
* **Foundations for the future:** How do established principles like [working in small batches](/capabilities/working-in-small-batches/) and [loosely coupled teams](/capabilities/loosely-coupled-teams/) interact with modern approaches like Platform Engineering and [value stream mapping](/guides/value-stream-management/) in an AI-assisted world?
* **The human and data connection:** We’re digging into the critical role of user-centricity, the quality of your data ecosystem, and how well teams can leverage internal AI data integration to create real value.

The goal is to understand which conditions and capabilities are proven to reduce burnout, improve team and product performance, and drive both delivery throughput and stability.

In March of 2025, DORA published the [Impact of Generative AI on Developer Productivity](/research/ai/gen-ai-report). This report offers research-backed guidance for leaders and practitioners to effectively navigate this transformation, providing actionable insights to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating potential risks. While the full 2025 DORA Report is still on the horizon, you can get immediate insights by [downloading the report now](/research/ai/gen-ai-report).
