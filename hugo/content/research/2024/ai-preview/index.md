## AI in the workplace: Adoption and impact

AI has dominated the tech landscape in recent years. But how has this powerful technology infiltrated the everyday lives of developers? DORA's recent survey sheds light on the current state of AI adoption and its perceived impact in the workplace.

This article provides an early preview into some of the findings about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace. The 2024 DORA Report will include a deeper exploration using more sophisticated statistical models to uncover the complex interplay of factors shaping this dynamic landscape.

This analysis offers a snapshot of how AI is being used and perceived by developers today.

We'll explore various aspects of AI adoption, including:

* [**Reliance**](#reliance-a-shift-in-the-development-landscape): How much does AI contribute to developers' specific tasks?
* [**Surfaces of Interaction**](#surfaces-of-interaction-where-ai-meets-development): Where do developers interact with AI in their work?
* [**Attitudes**](#attitudes-trust-and-transparency-in-the-age-of-ai): How do developers feel about AI's impact on their productivity, career, and the world?
* [**Future Reflections**](#future-reflections-navigating-the-impact-of-ai): What predictions do developers have about the impact of AI on various aspects of their lives?

### Reliance: a shift in the development landscape

We examined the extent to which developers rely on AI for various tasks related to software development. The results revealed a significant increase in AI adoption across a range of activities compared to last year's data.

#### Question

For the primary application or service you work on, how much have you relied on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the completion of each of the following tasks over the last 3 months?

Response options:

Not at all relied on, Minimally relied on, Somewhat relied on, Extremely relied on, I don't know, We do not perform this task,

* Code explanation
* Optimizing code (for example, reducing the complexity of a function)
* Debugging
* Summarizing or accessing information
* Analyzing data (for example, logs)
* Analyzing security
* Writing code blocks or functions (for example, auto-completion, auto-generation or auto-formatting)
* Writing tests
* Writing documentation
* Migrating from one language to another
* Modernizing legacy codebases
* Code reviews

#### Observation

The majority of respondents reported at least some reliance on AI for tasks like code explanation, documentation, writing code, code optimization, and code explanation. This suggests a growing acceptance and integration of AI tools into the core activities of software development.

#### Hypothesis

The types of tasks developers rely on AI for might be influenced by factors such as the maturity of AI tools available for those specific tasks and the perceived reliability of AI in performing those functions. Additionally, we suspect as more developers use more AI, they will naturally become more reliant on it.

### Surfaces of interaction: where AI meets development

We investigated the "surfaces" where developers interact with AI, focusing on the environments and tools where AI is most commonly encountered.

#### Question
At work in the last three months, how frequently have you interacted with AI in each of the following areas:

Response options: Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always, I don't know or NA

* My development environment (your code editor or IDE)
* Internal web interfaces (for example, internal websites, portals, and documentation)
* External web interfaces (for example, external websites, portals, and documentation)
* Conversational AI interfaces (for example, chatbots in my IDE or on websites)
* As an automated part of our tool chain (for example, our integration, build, or test services)
* Within 3rd-party tools and platforms I use for development (excluding my IDE)
* Other

The development environment (IDE) and internal web interfaces emerged as the most common surfaces for AI interaction, followed by external web interfaces and chatbots.

#### Observation
AI was prevalent in IDEs and internal web interfaces suggesting that organizations are increasingly incorporating AI features directly into the tools developers use daily, likely to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

However, it's worth noting that a significant portion of respondents reported not interacting with AI as an automated part of their tool chain.

#### Hypothesis

The limited interaction with AI through tool chains could also be due to a lack of awareness about the specific benefits of using AI for certain tasks, leading developers to rely on traditional methods. It may also be a reflection of the early emphasis of using AI to generate code.

### Attitudes: trust and transparency in the age of AI

We explored developer attitudes towards AI, focusing on trust and transparency. We asked respondents about their level of trust in the quality of AI-generated code and their organization's transparency regarding AI implementation.

#### Question

In the last 3 months, how much did you trust the quality of the output from AI-generated code as part of your development work?

Response options: Not at all, A little, Somewhat, A lot, A great deal, I don't know or NA

#### Observation

There is a relatively low level of trust in AI-generated code. More than half of respondents reported having a little or no trust. This indicates a significant degree of skepticism and cautiousness among developers when it comes to relying on AI-generated outputs.

We also investigated developer perceptions of organizational transparency regarding AI.

#### Question

My organization is being transparent about how AI is being used.

Response options: Strongly agree, Mostly agree, Somewhat agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Somewhat disagree, Mostly disagree, Strongly disagree, I don't know or NA

#### Observation

While the majority of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed with the statement, a significant portion expressed neutral or negative sentiments. This suggests room for improvement in terms of how organizations communicate their AI strategies and plans to their development teams.

Google Cloud's Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) published How to craft an [Acceptable Use Policy for gen AI (and look smart doing it)](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-craft-an-acceptable-use-policy-for-gen-ai-and-look-smart-doing-it?e=48754805). This article recommends having a well-defined Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to help with risk mitigation, strategic organizational alignment, and promoting compliance.

### Future reflections: navigating the impact of AI
Beyond its current applications, AI's potential impact on the future of work, productivity, and society is a topic of much discussion and speculation. To explore developer sentiments on this issue, we asked them to predict the impact of AI on various aspects of their lives within different timeframes: the next year, the next five years, and the next ten years.

#### Question
When you think about the following areas, what kind of impact do you think AI will have within the next [year, five years, ten years]?

Response options: Extremely negative impact, Somewhat negative impact, No impact, Somewhat positive impact, Extremely positive impact, I don't know.

#### Observations

* The perception of a negative impact on career trajectories increases over longer timeframes, with more respondents expressing concern about the long-term (10+ years) effects of AI on their career. This could reflect anxieties about job displacement or the changing skill sets required in an AI-driven workplace.
* Concerns about AI's negative impact on product quality and software delivery processes remain relatively low across all timeframes. This suggests a degree of confidence in AI's ability to enhance these aspects of software development.
* Concerns about the broader societal and environmental impacts of AI are more pronounced, especially in the long term. This aligns with wider public discourse surrounding the ethical implications and potential risks associated with AI development and deployment.

#### Hypothesis

The increasing concern about AI's impact on careers over time may be driven by a combination of factors, including media narratives around job automation, evolving job roles, and the need for continuous upskilling to stay relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape.

### Conclusions and looking ahead

This year's DORA survey respondents offer valuable insights into the evolving relationship between AI and software development, thank you to everyone who participated!

We see widespread adoption of AI for various tasks, particularly within IDEs and internal web platforms, indicating a growing integration of AI into developer workflows. However, concerns around trust in AI-generated code and organizational transparency regarding AI implementation highlight important considerations for the responsible development and deployment of AI in the workplace.

The adoption of AI is showing impact on many different aspects of team performance including areas like

* Productivity
* Flow
* Documentation quality
* Job satisfaction
* Time spent doing creative work
* Delivery stability

The 2024 DORA Report will include a deeper exploration of AI in the workplace. The report will look into the relationships between AI adoption, developer practices, and organizational outcomes, using more sophisticated statistical models to uncover the complex interplay of factors shaping this dynamic landscape.

As AI continues to reshape the software development landscape, understanding these nuances will be essential for maximizing the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks.
