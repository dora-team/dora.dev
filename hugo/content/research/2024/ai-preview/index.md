    For the primary application or service you work on, how much have you relied on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the completion of each of the following tasks over the last 3 months?
    <div class="responses">
        <label>Response options:</label>
        <span class="answer">Not at all relied on</span>
        <span class="answer">Minimally relied on</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat relied on</span>
        <span class="answer">Extremely relied on</span>
        <span class="answer">I don't know or NA</span>
    </div>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>Code explanation</div>

    <li>
        <div>Summarizing or accessing information</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Analyzing data (for example, logs)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Analyzing security</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Writing code blocks or functions (for example, auto-completion, auto-generation or auto-formatting)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Writing tests</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Writing documentation</div>

    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Code reviews</div>
    </li>
</ul>

#### Observation

The majority of respondents reported at least some reliance on AI for tasks like code explanation, documentation, writing code, code optimization, and code explanation. This suggests a growing acceptance and integration of AI tools into the core activities of software development.

#### Hypothesis

The types of tasks developers rely on AI for might be influenced by factors such as the maturity of AI tools available for those specific tasks and the perceived reliability of AI in performing those functions. Additionally, we suspect as more developers use more AI, they will naturally become more reliant on it.

### Surfaces of interaction: where AI meets development

We investigated the "surfaces" where developers interact with AI, focusing on the environments and tools where AI is most commonly encountered.

##### Question
<p class="description">
    At work in the last three months, how frequently have you interacted with AI in each of the following areas:
    <div class="responses">
        <label>Response options:</label>
        <span class="answer">Never</span>
        <span class="answer">Rarely</span>
        <span class="answer">Sometimes</span>
        <span class="answer">Often</span>
        <span class="answer">Always</span>
        <span class="answer">I don't know or NA</span>
    </div>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>My development environment (your code editor or IDE)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Internal web interfaces (for example, internal websites, portals, and documentation)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>External web interfaces (for example, external websites, portals, and documentation)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Conversational AI interfaces (for example, chatbots in my IDE or on websites)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>As an automated part of our tool chain (for example, our integration, build, or test services)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Within 3rd-party tools and platforms I use for development (excluding my IDE)</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>Other</div>
    </li>
</ul>


The development environment (IDE) and internal web interfaces emerged as the most common surfaces for AI interaction, followed by external web interfaces and chatbots.

#### Observation
AI was prevalent in IDEs and internal web interfaces suggesting that organizations are increasingly incorporating AI features directly into the tools developers use daily, likely to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

However, it's worth noting that a significant portion of respondents reported not interacting with AI as an automated part of their tool chain.

#### Hypothesis

The limited interaction with AI through tool chains could also be due to a lack of awareness about the specific benefits of using AI for certain tasks, leading developers to rely on traditional methods. It may also be a reflection of the early emphasis of using AI to generate code.

### Attitudes: trust and transparency in the age of AI

We explored developer attitudes towards AI, focusing on trust and transparency. We asked respondents about their level of trust in the quality of AI-generated code and their organization's transparency regarding AI implementation.

##### Question

<p class="description">
    In the last 3 months, how much did you trust the quality of the output from AI-generated code as part of your development work?
    <div class="responses">
        <label>Response options:</label>
        <span class="answer">Not at all</span>
        <span class="answer">A little</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat</span>
        <span class="answer">A lot</span>
        <span class="answer">A great deal</span>
        <span class="answer">I don't know or NA</span>
    </div>
</p>

#### Observation

There is a relatively low level of trust in AI-generated code. More than half of respondents reported having a little or no trust. This indicates a significant degree of skepticism and cautiousness among developers when it comes to relying on AI-generated outputs.

We also investigated developer perceptions of organizational transparency regarding AI.

##### Question

<p class="description">
    My organization is being transparent about how AI is being used.
    <div class="responses">
        <label>Response options:</label>
        <span class="answer">Strongly agree</span>
        <span class="answer">Mostly agree</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat agree</span>
        <span class="answer">Neither agree nor disagree</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat disagree</span>
        <span class="answer">Mostly disagree</span>
        <span class="answer">Strongly disagree</span>
        <span class="answer">I don't know or NA</span>
    </div>
</p>

#### Observation

While the majority of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed with the statement, a significant portion expressed neutral or negative sentiments. This suggests room for improvement in terms of how organizations communicate their AI strategies and plans to their development teams.

Google Cloud's Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) published How to craft an [Acceptable Use Policy for gen AI (and look smart doing it)](https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-to-craft-an-acceptable-use-policy-for-gen-ai-and-look-smart-doing-it?e=48754805). This article recommends having a well-defined Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) to help with risk mitigation, strategic organizational alignment, and promoting compliance.

### Future reflections: navigating the impact of AI
Beyond its current applications, AI's potential impact on the future of work, productivity, and society is a topic of much discussion and speculation. To explore developer sentiments on this issue, we asked them to predict the impact of AI on various aspects of their lives within different timeframes: the next year, the next five years, and the next ten years.

##### Question

<p class="description">
    When you think about the following areas, what kind of impact do you think AI will have within the next [year, five years, ten years]?
    <div class="responses">
        <label>Response options:</label>
        <span class="answer">Extremely negative impact</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat negative impact</span>
        <span class="answer">No impact</span>
        <span class="answer">Somewhat positive impact</span>
        <span class="answer">Extremely positive impact</span>
        <span class="answer">I don't know</span>
    </div>
</p>

#### Observations

* The perception of a negative impact on career trajectories increases over longer timeframes, with more respondents expressing concern about the long-term (10+ years) effects of AI on their career. This could reflect anxieties about job displacement or the changing skill sets required in an AI-driven workplace.
* Concerns about AI's negative impact on product quality and software delivery processes remain relatively low across all timeframes. This suggests a degree of confidence in AI's ability to enhance these aspects of software development.
* Concerns about the broader societal and environmental impacts of AI are more pronounced, especially in the long term. This aligns with wider public discourse surrounding the ethical implications and potential risks associated with AI development and deployment.

#### Hypothesis

The increasing concern about AI's impact on careers over time may be driven by a combination of factors, including media narratives around job automation, evolving job roles, and the need for continuous upskilling to stay relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape.
