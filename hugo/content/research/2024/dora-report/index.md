## Coming Soon!

### What's new for 2024?

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - Last year we asked the importance of AI in your daily work. This year we are expanding our inquiry in this area to better understand how AI is changing your work and the impact of those changes. How is AI impacting organizational performance?
  * Preview our early findings:  [AI in the workplace: adoption and impact](ai-preview).
  * Read about [fostering developers' trust in generative artificial intelligence](trust-in-ai).
* **Platform Engineering** - We want to better understand how your organization is approaching platform engineering. Platform engineering may include both technologies and teams. How does platform engineering impact software delivery performance?
* **Developer Experience** - We want to learn more about your overall experience as you work to deliver for your customers. How does your experience impact the value you're able to deliver?

We expect to publish the 2024 DORA report sometime in October, 2024. [Join the DORA community](https://dora.community) to be notified when the report is published, for discussions with the rest of the community, and for future research study participation opportunities.
