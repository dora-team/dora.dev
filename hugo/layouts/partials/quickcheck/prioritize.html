            <h2>What's holding you back?</h2>
            <p>
                In our <a href='{{ "/research/" | relURL }}'>research</a>, DORA has identified several key capabilities which drive higher software delivery and organizational performance. Improving these technical, process, and cultural capabilities can help your team deliver more value to your customers and organization. It's important to focus your efforts on the specific thing that  is currently holding you back. While every team will take a different journey, we have identified three capabilities that are often beneficial to improve: <strong>Continuous&nbsp;Integration</strong>, <strong>Streamlining&nbsp;Change&nbsp;Approvals</strong>, and <strong>Westrum&nbsp;Organizational&nbsp;Culture</strong>.

            <h2>Capability 1 of 3: Continuous Integration</h2>
            <p>Continuous integration (CI) is the first step towards continuous delivery. This is a development practice where code is regularly checked in, and each check-in triggers a set of quick tests to discover serious regressions, which developers fix immediately. The CI process creates canonical builds and packages that are ultimately deployed and released. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
