This is a development practice where code is regularly checked in, and each check-in triggers a set of quick tests to discover serious regressions, which developers fix immediately. The CI process creates canonical builds and packages that are ultimately deployed and released.",

These processes are often the primary controls to reduce the operational and security risks of change. Change approvals can be implemented through peer review during the development process, supplemented by automation to detect, prevent, and correct bad changes early in the software delivery life cycle.",
