<p>Applying lean principles revolutionized manufacturing in the last century. Organizations that reduced batch sizes, reduced work in process, and shortened and amplified feedback loops achieved dramatic increases in plant productivity, product quality, and customer satisfaction&mdash;and success in the marketplace. When you apply these same lean principles to technology, the emergent paradigm is DevOps. We studied three common practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabiltiies/process/wip-limits/"><strong>Work-in-process limits</strong></a>. The ability of teams to limit work in process (WIP) and use these limits to drive process improvement, which increases throughput.</li>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabiltiies/process/visual-management"><strong>Visual management</strong></a>. The extent to which teams create and maintain visual displays that show key quality and productivity metrics and the current status of work (including defects), and how they align these metrics with their operational goals.</li>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabiltiies/process/monitoring-systems"><strong>Monitoring systems to inform business decisions</strong></a>. The extent to which teams use data from application performance and infrastructure monitoring tools to make daily business decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of WIP limits and visual displays is well known in the lean community. These practices help expose obstacles to flow and ensure that teams donâ€™t become overburdened. WIP limits on their own don't strongly predict delivery performance. However, when you combine them with visual displays and a feedback loop from production monitoring tools, you see a stronger positive effect on software delivery performance.</p>

<p>Together, these practices drive <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a>, and they also have an impact on <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a> and on levels of <a onclick="linkTo('burnout');">burnout</a>.</p>
