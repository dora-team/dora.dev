<p>Lean and agile approaches to product development have become increasingly popular over the last decade. Our approach focuses on four capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabilities/process/working-in-small-batches/"><strong>Working in small batches</strong>.</a> The extent to which teams break products and features into small batches that can be completed in less than a week and released frequently, including the use of MVPs (minimum viable products).</li>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabilities/process/work-visibility-in-value-stream/"><strong>Visibility of work in the value stream</strong>.</a> Whether teams understand the workflow from business to customers, and whether they have visibility into this flow, including the status of products and features.</li>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabilities/process/customer-feedback/"><strong>Customer feedback</strong>.</a> Whether organizations actively and regularly seek customer feedback and incorporate it into their product design.</li>
  <li><a href="/devops-capabilities/process/team-experimentation/"><strong>Team experimentation</strong>.</a> Whether development teams have the authority to create and change specifications as part of the development process without requiring approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to our analysis, these factors were statistically significant in predicting higher <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a> and <a onclick="linkTo('org-perf');">organizational performance</a>, as well as improving <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a> and decreasing <a onclick="linkTo('burnout');">burnout</a>. We also found that software delivery performance predicts lean product management practices, a relationship known as a <em>virtuous cycle</em>. More effective software delivery improves your ability to work in small batches and incorporate customer feedback.</p>
