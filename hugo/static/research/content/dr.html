<p>Every organization that runs mission-critical software systems should have a disaster recovery plan. But it's essential to test the plan. We asked how frequently organizations perform the following types of disaster recovery tests on production infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simulations that disrupt production systems (including failure injection such as degrading network links or turning off routers)</li>
  <li>Infrastructure (including datacenter) failover</li>
  <li>Application failure</li>
</ul>

<p>Only 40% of respondents in 2019 performed disaster recovery testing at least annually using one or more of the methods listed. Organizations that conduct disaster recovery tests are more likely to have higher levels of <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">service availability</a>&mdash;that is, the ability for technology teams and organizations to make and keep promises and assertions about the software product or service they are operating.</p>
