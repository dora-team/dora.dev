<p>Retrospectives, learning reviews, and post-mortems are team-based activities designed to learn systematically from past events in order to improve future performance. Delivery teams carry out retrospectives on a regular cadence and perform post-mortems or learning reviews after incidents.</p>
<p>Both the agile and operations communities emphasize the importance of making these activities &ldquo;blameless.&rdquo; For example, in his 2001 work <em>Agile Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews</em>, Norm Kerth presents the &ldquo;Retrospective Prime Directive,&rdquo; which he suggests participants read at the beginning of a retrospective. He says, &ldquo;Regardless of what we discover, we must understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what was known at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Learning reviews and retrospectives help contribute to a <a href="/capabilities/learning-culture">climate for learning</a>, and also impact <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">organizational culture</a>. When teams conduct these reviews and retrospectives, they learn from their mistakes and failures and turn them into opportunities to improve how they work. In particular, teams that leverage their findings to implement changes to tooling, processes, or procedures see the strongest impacts.</p>
