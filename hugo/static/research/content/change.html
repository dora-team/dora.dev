<p>Most IT organizations have change management processes to manage the life cycle of changes to IT services, both internal and customer-facing. These processes are often the primary controls to reduce the operational and security risks of change. Change management processes often include approvals by external reviewers or change approval boards (CABs) to promote changes through the system.</p>

<p>Our research shows that formal change management processes that require the approval of an external body such as a change advisory board (CAB) or a senior manager have a negative impact on <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a>. Furthermore, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that a more formal approval process is associated with lower change fail rates. However the data does support the hypothesis that introducing more approvals results in a slower process and less frequent releases of large batches, with an accompanying higher impact on the production system that is likely associated with higher levels of risk and thus higher change fail rates.</p>

<p>We recommend that organizations move away from external change approval because of the negative effects on performance. Instead, organizations should &ldquo;shift left&rdquo; to peer review-based approval during the development process. In addition to implementing peer review, organizations can leverage the <a onclick="linkTo('tech-practices');">technical practices behind continuous delivery</a> to detect, prevent, and correct bad changes much earlier in the delivery lifecycle. This way, developers can correct errors faster than if they were waiting for a formal review.</p>

<p>The goal is to move away from the traditional, formal change management process. Better communicating the existing process and helping teams navigate it also improves software delivery performance. When team members understand the change approval process, it drives <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">higher performance</a> and contributes to lower levels of <a onclick="linkTo('burnout');">burnout</a> and increased <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">psychological safety</a>. To achieve these ends, team members must be confident they can get changes approved in a timely manner. They must know the steps to go from &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; to &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; every time.</p>
