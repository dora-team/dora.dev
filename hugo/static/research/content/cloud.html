<p>The USA's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final">defines</a> five essential characteristics of cloud computing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>On-demand self-service</strong>. Consumers can provision computing resources as needed, automatically, without any human interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Broad network access</strong>. Capabilities are widely available and can be accessed through heterogeneous platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource pooling</strong>. Provider resources are pooled in a multi-tenant model, with physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned on demand. The customer generally has no direct control over the exact location of provided resources, but may specify location at a higher level of abstraction (for example country, state, or datacenter).</li>
  <li><strong>Rapid elasticity</strong>. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to rapidly scale outward or inward according to demand. Consumer capabilities available for provisioning appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Measured service</strong>. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (for example storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although most people using cloud services do not meet all of these characteristics, in terms of <a onclick="linkTo('sdo-perf');">software delivery performance</a>, those who do are over 20 times more likely to be in the elite group than the low-performing group.</p>
<p>Broad network access and on-demand self-service are often overlooked. These characteristics are especially important because they directly affect performance outcomes for consumers. For example, some cloud implementations still require that users raise tickets in order to access critical resources, or that they cannot access cloud systems easily from their devices. From the consumers&rsquo; perspective, they might as well be using a traditional datacenter. This is a huge barrier to realizing the efficiency improvements in delivery process that lead to higher-performance teams.</p>
