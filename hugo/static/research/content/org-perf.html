<p>Organizational performance measures the ability of an organization to achieve commercial and non-commercial goals. Academic research has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4877979_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_the_Levers_of_Control_Framework">validated this measure</a> and found it to be highly correlated to measures of return on investment (ROI), and it is robust to economic cycles.</p>

<p>Combined, commercial and non-commercial goals include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Profitability</li>
  <li>Productivity</li>
  <li>Market share</li>
  <li>Number of customers</li>
  <li>Quantity of products or services</li>
  <li>Operating efficiency</li>
  <li>Customer satisfaction</li>
  <li>Quality of products or services provided</li>
  <li>Achieving organization or mission goals</li>
</ul>

<p>Several years of analysis shows that, compared to low performers, organizations with the highest level of software delivery performance are <em>twice as likely</em> to exceed their goals. Organizational performance is also driven by <a onclick="linkTo('culture');">culture and work environment</a>, and by <a onclick="linkTo('lean-product');">lean product development practices</a>.</p>
